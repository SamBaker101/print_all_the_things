#PATT (Print All The Things)
PATT is an ongoing project to create fabrication robotics using salvaged mechanical materials and homebrew software.

This project exists primarily to develope and showcase my own skills and is not necessarily intended to be used in production (at this point)

This repository specifically is intended as a placeholder as I experiment, as I develope SW, HW or firmware platforms I will be breaking them out to their own repositories.
